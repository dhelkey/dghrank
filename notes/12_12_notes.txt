#TODO TODAY
CLEAN ROOM
visualizeReturner()
get null simulations running to append to existing file 




View methods for the different graphs

##This is the ideal case for GGplot actually....]
#Or make our own....

plot institutions
plot instutions according to another order...





##Try adding another score that is each dist transformed into a z-score, in such a way that inference is preserved...



plot est, score
composite
subset?

only show significant scores



add - labels



input returner
choose inst_mat,
choose score/est (if no est, throw error)
#grab returner[[mat]]
